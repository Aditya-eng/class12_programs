# #If we want to write a structure such as list or
#
# dictionary to a file and read it subsequently
# we need to use the Python module pickle.
# Pickling is the process of converting structure
#
# to a byte stream before writing to a file and
# while reading the content of file a reverse
# process
#
# unpickling is used to convert the byte stream back to the original format.
